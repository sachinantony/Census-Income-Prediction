# Census Income Prediction

Census Income Prediction predicts whether income of an individual exceeds $50K/year based oncensus data.The census data contains attributes like age, education, occupation, capital gain,capital loss, hours-per-week and based on these attributes we need to predict if the income ofthe individual exceeds $50K per year. We are implementing this concept based on NBTreealgorithm. We show that in some larger databases, the accuracy of Naive-Bayes does not scaleup as well as decision trees. NBTree which induces a fusion of decision-tree classifiers and NaïveBayes classifiers i.e., the decision-tree nodes contain univariate splits as regular decision-trees,but the leaves contain Naive-Bayesian classifiers.
